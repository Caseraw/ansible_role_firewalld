### Default zone.
## The default is always set to public. Change this if needed.
## Whn defining a non standard zone, make sure to create it in a list
## variable starting with the name `role_firewalld_rule_list_`.
## The default will then be set after a new zone is created.

role_firewalld_default_zone: public

### Managing user groups.
## Minimum required values: 'name' and 'state'.
##
## For better maintainability, the group list is built during runtime by
## combining all lists together. This will provide the freedom of declaring
## custom group lists for granular control. The lists require a naming
## convention by using a pattern. The pattern is rendered as a single list
## which can be used for iteration with variable: 'role_firewalld_rule_list'
## The list name pattern needs to start with: 'role_firewalld_rule_list_'

role_firewalld_rule_list_default: []

## Example of a list for default inheritance:
# role_firewalld_rule_list_default:
#   - name: Enable SSH in public zone
#     state: enabled
#     zone: public
#     service: ssh
#     permanent: True
#     immediate: True
#     restart_handler: start_restart_firewalld
#   - name: Disable DHCP v6 Client in public zone
#     state: disabled
#     zone: public
#     service: dhcpv6-client
#     permanent: True
#     immediate: True
